# TODO

- Validate SMS reception and upload on Android 10, 11, 12, 13 with OEM skins (Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo).
- Add guided OEM-specific instructions (battery optimization, auto-start, background restrictions).
- Add optional remote config authentication/signature verification.
- Consider server support for storing and displaying extra metadata fields.
- Add Play Store-ready notification wording and icon set.
- Decide whether to remove legacy React Native files under `smsrelay2/`.
